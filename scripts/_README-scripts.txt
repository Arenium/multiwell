which this README-scripts file resides: 

multiwell-<version>/scripts

They are executed by typing, for example

         ./runtest_all
              or
         ./admin-multi-examples
         ./admin-densum-examples
         ./admin-mominert-example
         ./admin-thermo-examples
         ./admin-paradensum-examples
         ./admin-bdens-examples
            etc.

runtest_all  Tests runs the current compiled versions with "test" input files.
             Runs a data file for most of the programs in the MultiWell

                      stored in the example directories. Optionally can replace

admin-mominert-example  Administers the mominert examples
                        Runs all of the mominert examples in the examples/
