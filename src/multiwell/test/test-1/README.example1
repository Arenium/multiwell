Example #1: Thermal Decomposition of Ge2H6

This example is loosely based on the reaction:

GeH3-GeH3  --> GeH2 + GeH4

The vibrational frequencies are contained in files "Ge2H6.vibs" and 
"Ge2H6TS.vibs" from  U. N. Alexander, N. A. Trout, K. D. King-KD, and W. D. 
Lawrance, Chem. Phys. Letters, 299, 291-5.  The moments of inertia were 
estimated, based on a MOPAC calculation.  Energy transfer parameters are 
strictly hypothetical.

Densities and sums of states were calculated using Densum and are contained in 
files "Ge2H6     .dens" and "Ge2H6TS   .dens".

"Germylene.dat" is the data file for MultiWell. Also given are the 
corresponding MultiWell output files.

The pressure-dependent unimolecular rate constant k(M,T) is given by

k(M,T) = k(inf,T) * f(M,T)

where k(inf,T) is the unimolecular decomposition rate constant at infinite 
pressure (obtained from MultiWell.OUT) and f(M,T) is the mole fraction of the 
stabilized Ge2H6 (obtained from MultiWell.OUT) produced at the same pressure and 
temperature.

For slow unimolecular reactions, calculation of f(M,T) will require many 
trials of long duration.
