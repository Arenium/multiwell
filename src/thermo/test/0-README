EXAMPLE:

SCTST-RATE-CONSTANT

Thermal rate constants computed uisng Semi-classical TST (as formulated by W. H. Miller and coworkers).

Reaction:

cis-HOCO --> H + CO2

How to compute the thermal rate constant:

1. Use GAUSSIAN, CFOUR, or other electronic structure code to compute energies, harmonic frequencies, and anharmonicities (via second-order vibrational perturbation theory, VPT2).

2. set up data files for programs 'adensum', 'sctst', and 'thermo' (see User Manual).

3. Since program 'thermo' uses output files generated by 'adensum' and 'sctst', those programs must be run first. Run the programs in the following order:
  1) adensum (data file 'adensum.dat')
  2) sctst   (data file 'sctst.dat')
  3) thermo  (data files 'thermo.dat', 'cis-HOCO.qvib','TS2.qcrp')
  
NOTE: if 'adensum' AND 'sctst' may be run by using pre-computed checkpoint files to speed up computation (see the User Manual). Make sure the species do not have the same names, or the checkpoint files will be over-written; this potential problem is avoided if they are NOT together in the same directory.
  
4. The rate constants are tabulated in file 'thermo.out'. The user-defined temperatures are at the end of the list of 50 temperatures that are automatically computed by default. Rate constants at the user-defined temperatures are obtained by interpolation.
